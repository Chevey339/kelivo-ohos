## 📖 Project Overview

This is an OpenHarmony-adapted version of [Kelivo](https://github.com/Chevey339/kelivo). Some minor features (like TTS functionality or code block highlighting) are not yet implemented due to some Flutter dependency support issues on HarmonyOS.

## 🔧 OpenHarmony Compatibility

This project has been adapted for the OpenHarmony system, ensuring stable operation on HarmonyOS devices.
